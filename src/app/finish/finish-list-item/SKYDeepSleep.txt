SKY deep sleep

RDK deep sleep
  - close file system
  - close sockets
Nothing should be using external network

UPnP -

RESUME - NEED TO KNOW CURENT IP ADDRESS - SENDS REQUEST TO DHCP SERVER
    State RFC Init reboot rather than init - try to reuse IP ADDRESS - Net server manager

    UPnP - On resume (brian sequenec diagram)


0.5W mode all gos 2W mode Ethernet/Wifi remains up (WiFi can be disabled).  DIAL one IP address advertises.  One one can register for wake on LAN.
Their 0.5W is the same as us. (problem deep->light)

Brian has sequence diagram  https://www.stb.bskyb.com/confluence/display/~bch03/Deep+Sleep+resume+-+Network


Neet the EPG etc to wait for network to be avaalible.  See
EPG wait for
1.  Interfaces are up. (Required for case nto connected at all)  EPG display offline screen (RDK requiers user input at this point.
                        On MR  ) /as/network/status updates.
                        EPG needs to handle /as/network/status -

            Network manager given notification to all components that it is not connected (no 5)
2.  IP address to be obtained

Refreshing DHCP address is required.

They need to clarify with RDK OnDefault interface changed then

NEED TO DEFINE NETWORK CONNECTION STATE MODEL ON STARTUP.

NEED TO UNDERSTAND Q NETWORH CONNECTIVITY ON STARTUP.  On MR

KEY AS knows it has got a network address.

VGDRM would need to be aware of
NETWORK aware componnets on resume need to wait for IP address to be acquired before starting up.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ON RESUME IP ADDRESS NOT USED UNTIL NETWORK IS AVALIABLE.



FUSION MR ONLY MESH _ IN MESH CASE differtn ballgame - having valid IP addresss still vialif
NGI-HELPER kicked off 5 onwards should be the same.

DMS Just block until IP address recieved. -----  other stuff needs to block.

Wait for network needed in sequences.

pppcm - querylu close socikes and reopen.
proper client close ppc connection.
verifier with ppc connection.
Not using VGV exceopt to VGDRM liceneve handling.
No card status/ppv.

Browser catalog

PPC can fail - does not mean that VGV proxy cant talk to Gatemela
  SW downlaod EMM'sleep
  Doing purchase etc

DRM-A does to need mire than SAC4.
