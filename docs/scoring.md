# APPENDIX A SCORING See rule 90.3.

## A1 NUMBER OF RACES

The number of races scheduled and the number required to be completed to constitute a series shall be stated in the notice of race or sailing instructions.

## A2 SERIES SCORES

A2.1 Each boat’s series score shall, subject to rule 90.3(b), be the total of her race scores excluding her worst score. (The notice of race or sailing instructions may make a different arrangement by providing, for example, that no score will be excluded, that two or more scores will be excluded, or that a specified number of scores will be excluded if a specified number of races are completed. A race is completed if scored; see rule 90.3(a).) If a boat has two or more equal worst scores, the score(s) for the race(s) sailed earliest in the series shall be excluded. The boat with the lowest series score wins and others shall be ranked accordingly.

A2.2 If a boat has entered any race in a series, she shall be scored for the whole series.

## A3 STARTING TIMES AND FINISHING PLACES

The time of a boat’s starting signal shall be her starting time, and the order in which boats finish a race shall determine their finishing places. However, when a handicap or rating system is used a boat’s corrected time shall determine her finishing place.

## A4 LOW POINT SYSTEM

The Low Point System will apply unless the notice of race or sailing instructions specify another system; see rule 90.3(a).

A4.1 Each boat starting and finishing and not thereafter retiring, being penalized or given redress shall be scored points as follows:
Finishing place Points
First 1
Second 2
Third 3
Fourth 4
Fifth 5
Sixth 6
Seventh 7
Each place thereafter Add 1 point

A4.2 A boat that did not start, did not finish, retired or was disqualified shall be scored points for the finishing place one more than the number of boats entered in the series. A boat that is penalized under rule 30.2 or that takes a penalty under rule 44.3(a) shall be scored points as provided in rule 44.3(c).

## A5 SCORES DETERMINED BY THE RACE COMMITTEE

A boat that did not start or finish or comply with rule 30.2, 30.3, 30.4 or 78.2, or that retires or takes a penalty under rule 44.3(a), shall be scored accordingly by the race committee without a hearing. Only the protest committee may take other scoring actions that worsen a boat’s score.

## A6 CHANGES IN PLACES AND SCORES OF OTHER BOATS

A6.1 If a boat is disqualified from a race or retires after finishing, each boat with a worse finishing place shall be moved up one place.

A6.2 If the protest committee decides to give redress by adjusting a boat’s score, the scores of other boats shall not be changed unless the protest committee decides otherwise.

## A7 RACE TIES

If boats are tied at the finishing line or if a handicap or rating system is used and boats have equal corrected times, the points for the place for which the boats have tied and for the place(s) immediately below shall be added together and divided equally. Boats tied for a race prize shall share it or be given equal prizes.

## A8 SERIES TIES

A8.1 If there is a series-score tie between two or more boats, each boat’s race scores shall be listed in order of best to worst, and at the first point(s) where there is a difference the tie shall be broken in favour of the boat(s) with the best score(s). No excluded scores shall be used.

A8.2 If a tie remains between two or more boats, they shall be ranked in order of their scores in the last race. Any remaining ties shall be broken by using the tied boats’ scores in the next-to-last race and so on until all ties are broken. These scores shall be used even if some of them are excluded scores.

## A9 RACE SCORES IN A SERIES LONGER THAN A REGATTA

For a series that is held over a period of time longer than a regatta, a boat that came to the starting area but did not start, did not finish, retired or was disqualified shall be scored points for the finishing place one more than the number of boats that came to the starting area. A boat that did not come to the starting area shall be scored points for the finishing place one more than the number of boats entered in the series.

## A10 GUIDANCE ON REDRESS

If the protest committee decides to give redress by adjusting a boat’s score for a race, it is advised to consider scoring her (a) points equal to the average, to the nearest tenth of a point (0.05 to be rounded upward), of her points in all the races in the series except the race in question;
(b) points equal to the average, to the nearest tenth of a point (0.05 to be rounded upward), of her points in all the races before the race in question; or
(c) points based on the position of the boat in the race at the time of the incident that justified redress.
